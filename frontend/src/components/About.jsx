        Welcome to our movie app â€” the final project for our course in
        Lighthouse Labs. Built using the TMDB API, this app lets users browse
        new releases, popular titles, and timeless classics. It features a
        clean, intuitive interface for easy navigation, a fun quiz that
        generates personalized movie recommendations using AI, and a login
        system to save your favorite films. Whether you're into thrillers,
        comedies, or dramas, our app helps you find the perfect movie for your
        next watch!
